# Fraud-Detection-using-Self-Organizing-Maps
Unsupervised Machine Learning

# Description
The bank had issued credit cards to its customers in past few years and the issuance was based on credit scores, applications etc. However, there are chances that some fraudulent applications got approved (due to human error or something). 

# Problem
Finding some possible frauds so that they can be further investigated by the bank, thus saving bank from possible losses in the future.

# Dataset Information
For this problem, getting a dataset from UCI machine learning repository. The name of the data set is Statlog (Australian Credit Approval) Data Set.
